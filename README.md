# ECPI_CIS367_Final
Final project for CIS367 Advance Server Side Scripting with PHP

This was the final build from my final project from my CIS367 Advance Server Side Scripting with PHP class at ECPI.

I scored an 88/100.

The assignment requirement was to create a web application that supports HTTPS communication, provides login authority levels for administrators and technicians, provides functionality based on the type of login, displays information contained in a database, and allows users to add additional records to the database.

# ECPI_CIS367_Final
Final project for CIS367 Advance Server Side Scripting with PHP

This was the final build from my final project from my CIS367 Advance Server Side Scripting with PHP class at ECPI.

I scored a 88/100 with my instructor commenting with-
"Overall a good job. What you did wrong was not follow the helpful tips at the bottom of the assignment - 
it told you how to form your index file and where to put your login file...and gave you the code for the index file...to avoid that problem. 
Happened to a lot of people...most just hard-coded the path in the require once call. 
The deductions are, well, because even after fixing that problem it generates a lot of errors and isn't really runnable and because you don't 
do any actual validation on the user add/update page. The fields will say required, but that won't stop it from saving and it isn't actually 
checked to see if there are values in the fields. Overall a nice job, though."

I haven't found the time at this current moment to go back and fix the errors that he was talking about, but will look into it in the future.
